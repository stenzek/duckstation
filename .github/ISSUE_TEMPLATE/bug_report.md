Please read before creating a new issue:

1. Make sure there is not already an open issue for this bug.
2. All enhancements **must** be off. To quickly disable all enhancements with affecting your normal config, in advanced options you can check "Disable All Enhancements".
3. All advanced options **must** be at their default values.
4. No cheats may be active. If you were using cheats, they should be disabled, and the game rebooted before reporting the bug.
5. Do not share save state files. Memory cards are okay.
6. Verify your dump, as we can not assist with issues resulting from bad dumps.
7. If playing PAL region software, please check whether or not the game has LibCrypt protection and that if it does, you have a correct SBI file (see https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation#libcrypt-protection-and-sbi-files for more information).
8. Please post your issue report in English as unfortunately this is the only language spoken by the developers. The Discord server has many helpful people if you need help translating.
9. If you are using the libretro core, please make sure that the bug also occurs in the standalone emulator. Bug reports only tested on the libretro core will not be investigated.
