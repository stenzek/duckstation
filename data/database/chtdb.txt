;Duckstation Cheat File
;**********************
;
; To edit this file I recommend Notepad++ and set up a user defined language
; for the cheat File as it helps readability.
;
;1. Start any comment lines with a semi-colon, this can be useful to split up
;   sections of cheats to improve readability as well as adding comments to
;   aid in understanding of the cheats. These comments do not appear in
;   Duckstation so remember to keep explanations in cheats for users. Try to
;   keep comment lines under 80 characters
;
;2. Cheat Naming conventions for multiplayer games is 'Px Cheat Description'
;   where x is the player number. Eg. P1 Infinite Lives. If the cheat is for all
;   players or you have only tested it for P1 then don't mention P1 eg
;   'Infinite Lives'
;
;3. Try to order cheats in a logical order if possible, like so:
;   * Cheats for all Players for all levels
;   * Cheats for P1 for all levels
;   * Cheats for P2 for all levels
;   * Cheats for P3 for all levels
;   * Cheats for P4 for all levels
;   * Cheats for all Players for level 1
;   * Cheats for P1 for level 1
;   * Cheats for P2 for level 1
;   * Cheats for P3 for level 1
;   * Cheats for P4 for level 1
;   * Cheats for all Players for level 2
;   * Cheats for P1 for level 2
;   * Cheats for P2 for level 2
;   * Cheats for P3 for level 2
;   * Cheats for P4 for level 2
;     repeat for other levels
;   * Cheats that you don't want to appear in the above list, I think this
;      should be kept for Debug Mode Cheats, 60FPS Cheats and the like.
;
;4. Cheats should be grouped if possible and worthwhile using the backslash '\'
;   character. Especially true for cheats that poke the same address(es) with
;   different value(s). This will make the cheat menus easier to skip long
;   option lists when you only need to enable one option.
;
;5. Header format:
;  ; [ Game Name (Region) (Year) (Publisher) {GAME_ID Numbers} <mameshortname> ]
;  :GAME_ID1
;  :GAME_ID2  <--repeat as necessary
;
; Well that's the plan anyway....let's see how it tracks out  Pugsy, 04 DEC 2020

;  Register Code Types
;  *******************
;  These codes utilise the internal global 256 32-bit cheat registers. As they
;  are global they will work across all cheats for a game so be careful not
;  to re-use registers unintendingly. Type 51 codes can be used to copy and
;  manipulate register contents between registers and memory. Type 52 codes are
;  block conditionals that you can test the registers with and branch accordingly.
;
;  These code types will only need to be used with very advanced cheats, only
;  use them if you need them as they may blow your mind....
; 
;  General Notes:
;  ==============
;  RegXX or RegYY means the immediate value of the register
;  (RegXX) or (RegYY) means the indirect value of the register = contents of the 
;                     address held in RegXX or RegYY*
;  TTTTTTTT = Write to Address TTTTTTTT
;  (TTTTTTTT) = Read from Address TTTTTTTT
;  ZZ,ZZZZ,ZZZZZZZ = Value
;  Note RegXX, RegYY, RegWW can be the same register

Perhaps the most interesting thing is that there's an earlier version of the player's sprite at the top of the room. Talking to anyone in the room will give you the option of starting the game at different areas, although it barely covers the full game and is only some select areas.
